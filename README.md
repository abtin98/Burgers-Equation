# Burgers-Equation
Implementation of the split form of Burgers' Equation in C++ using the Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme.
Currently the scheme is in split, weak form, with collocated Gauss-Lobatto nodes for quadrature and interpolation.
The code is in C++ and templated so it can be run in any dimension.
